## Week 2 Assignment (Friday class)
[Back to main page](https://coulterjones.github.io/New-School-NND-III-spring18/)

Using this [campus crime data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pph3Guh1y2aVLoNKj8AEHwUnjTLwYqJXxCp6qwbrk9A/edit#gid=0) answer the questions below.

First, make a copy of the data (**File** > **Make a copy...**)

1. Which year had the most Drug law and	Liquor law violations at the New School per student and what was the rate?
Which year had the second highest rate?

2. Which year had the most liquor law violations in total? 

3. For all years combined (2001-2016) Which state had more Liquor law violations per student, New York or New Jersey?

To most effectively answer these questions you will need to remember how to use the filter and Subtotal functions, which is in explained in the [Common Formulas & Functions tipsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EdF8_29LYLjRPagUmEdrs_4lcOip_XT1gjDUQBrSsSM/edit#heading=h.h8oucprv8ejs
). You will also need to remember how to use Pivot Tables in Google Sheets. If you don't remember how this works, Google has a [general guide](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1272900?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) that can be very helpufl. 

We're using Google Sheets for this class, but if you feel more comfortable in Excel there is a helpful [IRE tipsheet](https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4362/) on the topic, which I've [downloaded and can be found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GOT51d6NOEJ3L_Iquk54Y91dc2gtcvJH/view?usp=sharing).

The principle is the same in either case. First, think about you want to aggregate. What is the category you want to group by that's what goes in to the *Rows* portion of the pivot table. What you want to add up or calculate goes in to the calculate field.
