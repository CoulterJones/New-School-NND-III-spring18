Details on the Buzzfeed data:
 - Over the course of seven weekdays (Sept. 19 to 23 and Sept. 26 and 27), BuzzFeed News logged and fact-checked every single post published by nine sources: three mainstream and six hyper partisan sites. Posts could be rated “mostly true,” “mixture of true and false,” or “mostly false.”

 - The Facebook reactions fields were obtained from Facebook (through an API) on October 11, 2016. For the details, here’s the [methodology](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check) that Buzzfeed used and was published with the story.
